This project is just a solution for the challenge:

Is an naive HTML5 approach using canvas.

What we do to detect the stripes, is basically check the similarity with other columns. And if the difference is too hight we know that thats a nice candidate for a stripe colum.

For de unshredder is almost the same. We compare the acual left size of the stripe with all the other left parts. So the best matches win!

The code is not really hard to understand despite of that there are some hardcoded values (some hurry). But might work in several cases as well.
